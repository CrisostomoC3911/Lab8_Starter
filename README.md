## Check Your Understanding

<ol>
      <li>Within a Github action that runs whenever we push. This makes it so it doesn't require every developer to manually run the code before being able to push reducing the time it takes to integrate. Running them all after development is a bad idea because smaller bugs are much easier to fix than large ones.</li>
  <li>No. This is overkill. It's okay to do end to end testing once in a while to check project health, but it shouldn't be done for function testing since it would take too long.</li>
  <li>No. I would need to also be able to check whether the message is able to be read by another end user which isn't within the message feature alone.</li>
  <li>Yes. This can be done by just checking input box, and it doesn't need to be sent.</li>
</ol>
